# NBA Height Distribution Analysis Interactive Visualization

This directory contains an interactive visualization that explores the relationship between NBA team height distributions and win percentages from 2001-2024.

## Overview

The visualization shows NBA teams plotted according to their roster height distributions using Laplacian Eigenmaps dimensionality reduction. Teams are categorized as either:

- **Trendy Teams (Lower Left)**: Teams with shorter, more uniform height distributions
- **Trend-Defying Teams (Upper Right)**: Teams with taller, more diverse height distributions

A season slider and search input allow users to explore different seasons and see how the average win percentages compare between these two categories.

## Files

- `generate_visualization.py`: Python script that generates the interactive visualization
- `index.html`: Main HTML page that embeds the interactive visualization
- `standalone_visualization.html`: A static preview of the visualization that works without running the Python script
- `nba_height_trends_interactive.html`: The interactive Bokeh visualization (generated by running the Python script)
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages

## How to View the Visualization

1. Run the Python script to generate the interactive visualization:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python generate_visualization.py
   ```
   
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the complete visualization with explanations

3. If you don't want to install dependencies, you can view `standalone_visualization.html` for a preview of what the visualization will look like.

## Features

- **Interactive Season Selection**: Use the slider or enter a specific season number to view data for a particular NBA season
- **Statistical Analysis**: View the average win percentages for trendy vs. trend-defying teams in each season
- **Team Listings**: See which specific teams fall into each category for any given season
- **Interactive Information**: Get details about individual teams by hovering over data points (or tapping on mobile devices)
- **Win Percentage Color Mapping**: Color-coded data points based on team success
- **Visual Guide**: Clear explanation of what trendy and trend-defying teams represent on the plot
- **Mobile Support**: Enhanced touch interactions for iPad and other mobile devices

## Required Data

The visualization requires two data files (located in the `Important DataFrames` directory):

- `le_df.csv`: Contains the Laplacian Eigenmaps coordinates and team data
- `team_trend_win_percentages.csv`: Contains win percentage data for teams

## Understanding the Plot Axes

- **X-Axis (Component 1)**: Represents the average height of players on the team (correlation > 95%)
- **Y-Axis (Component 2)**: Represents the variance in player heights (correlation > 90%)

## Team Classification

For each season, teams are classified based on their position on the plot:

- **Trendy Teams**: The 5 teams closest to the lower left (shorter players with more uniform heights)
- **Trend-Defying Teams**: The 5 teams closest to the upper right (taller players with more diverse heights)

This allows comparison of whether teams with traditional roster construction tend to perform better or worse than teams with non-traditional approaches.
