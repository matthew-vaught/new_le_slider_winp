# GitHub Upload Instructions

To fix the iPad tap functionality and update the GitHub Pages site, you need to upload the following files:

1. **Main files:**
   - `index.html` - Updated with iPad touch support and script
   - `nba_height_trends_interactive.html` - The latest visualization file
   - `standalone_visualization.html` - Updated with iPad touch support
   - `.nojekyll` - Empty file to prevent Jekyll processing

2. **Documentation:**
   - `README.md` - Updated with mobile support information
   - `ipad_tap_functionality_fix.md` - New documentation file explaining changes

## Important Notes

1. Make sure to upload the `.nojekyll` file - this is critical for proper GitHub Pages display.
2. If the visualization still doesn't display, check the repository settings to ensure GitHub Pages is set to use the `docs` folder.

## GitHub Pages Settings

1. Go to the repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", ensure it's set to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select the branch (main) and folder (/docs) where your site files are located
5. Click Save

After uploading all files, wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild your site.
